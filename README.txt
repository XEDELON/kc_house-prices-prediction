# Data Analysis Project

Hey there! This is a data analysis project that I worked on. It's a Jupyter Notebook that explores and processes data using Python. Whether you're here to check out my work or run it yourself, you're in the right place.

## What This Project Does

- Loads and processes data
- Performs some analysis (charts, stats, or trends—whatever I needed to figure out)
- Uses Python libraries to get the job done efficiently

## How to Use It

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook dataAnalysis.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells and check out the outputs!

## Requirements

Check out `requirements.txt` for the exact dependencies you'll need.

## Notes

- Make sure you have Python installed.
- If you run into any issues, double-check your library versions.

## Scores

- In the file you can see that the best algorithm to achieve the highest score was Random Forest.
- (R²: 82% || MSE: 9589021469)

That's it! Hope this helps.
